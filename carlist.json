The German brand offers two phenomenal engines for this model—a 255-hp four-cylinder and a 385-hp straight-six—both of which are as quick as they are refined. There's also a plug-in hybrid for the green crowd. While we're saddened by BMW's decision to eliminate the manual transmission, the perceptive eight-speed automatic is a worthy substitute. What's more, the 3's fantastic chassis can seamlessly shift from calm to frisky at a moment's notice. Unfortunately, its steering—although improved over the previous generation's—still lacks the tactility that enthusiasts once idolized. The 2021 3-series fulfills its mission as an entry-level premium sedan with ample cabin and trunk space as well as copious amounts of luxury and technology.",
