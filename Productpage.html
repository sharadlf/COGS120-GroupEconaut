	<p><b>Description:</b>
	The 2021 BMW 3-series epitomizes the modern sports sedan with its comprehensive performance and innate sophistication. The German brand offers two phenomenal engines for this model—a 255-hp four-cylinder and a 385-hp straight-six—both of which are as quick as they are refined. There's also a plug-in hybrid for the green crowd. While we're saddened by BMW's decision to eliminate the
		manual transmission, the perceptive eight-speed automatic is a worthy substitute. What's more, the 3's fantastic chassis can seamlessly shift from calm to frisky at a moment's notice. Unfortunately, its steering—although improved over the previous generation's—still lacks the tactility that enthusiasts once idolized. The 2021 3-series fulfills its mission as an entry-level premium sedan with ample cabin and trunk space as well as copious amounts of luxury and technology.</p>
